In our problem lock is acquired on line 126 in our customer thread. Our lock is released 
on line 101 in worker thread. Queue was shared between both threads. We initialized binary semaphore where its
 value is set to 0 and if the lock is acquired the customer is added into queue and if queue is full our customer thread
  goes to sleep for random interval and tries again later.
